# Robotic-Barista

This project works on developing a robotic barista using UR10, including functions of: 
1. receiving order from Android app
2. preparing coffee using semi-automatic coffee machine
3. ething latte art pattern
4. detecting position of coffee cup using AprilTag
5. delivering coffee

The files contain main program for coffee and latte art making and supporting drivers. As a final year design project of mechanical enginnering studetns from HKUST, it is hope that the project can be expanded to enhance functionality of the robotic barista.
